# React Native Uninitialized State Access Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications: attempting to access state variables before they've been initialized.  This often occurs when using asynchronous operations (like fetching data) to update the state.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a component that fetches data from an API.  However, it tries to render the data before the state has been updated from the API call, leading to a runtime error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'title')`.

## Solution

The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`, utilizes conditional rendering to handle the case where the data is still loading.  This prevents attempting to access properties of a null or undefined object.  We check if the `data` state is null before accessing its properties.
